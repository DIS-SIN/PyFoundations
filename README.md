# DOL: Foundations Python Port

In order to have a larger pool of available developers, and to ensure continuity, we are porting the MVP of Foundations written in Go, over to a Python/Flask app (that the team is more versed in)

# General Development Information

DOL is build in Python, Flask, and uses jQuery and JSON to handle the front end work. The backend is a lightweight db which stores the answers to our questions. 

This project helped us learn how to work better as a team using github, and gave us more practice in division of labor and each developer working on different parts in parallel.

# Getting it Running
