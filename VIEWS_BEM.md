# Application BEMs (Block, Element, Modifiers)

To provide the best user experience with graceful degradation for older browsers, we will focus on creating a front-end that adheres to the BEM design methodology (https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/). To achieve this goal while maintaining framework agnostisicm, we will use Material Design Lite (https://getmdl.io/index.html)

The following is a short list of the Views, Blocks, Elements, and Modifiers we will be creating and managing.
